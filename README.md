# ppfmft
maybe one day it will become a plugin for PyMol that runs fmft

Goals:
1. To make comboboxes show files already uploaded (and maybe changed) in current PyMol session (have no idea for now how to do that)
2. To make the button run fmft properly (for now it runs fmft with subprocess.Popen, need to think about details)
