Using spf coefficients calculated up to N = 20 to compute 8 correlations.
Using FFT grid with dimensions: 16 x 16 x (30 x 30 x 30)
Using angular cutoff of 11.61 deg. for filtering. (Largest grid step is 12.00 deg.)
"Raw" translation range: 0.00 - 60.00 Angstrom, step: 1.00 Angstrom
Results will be provided relative to the reference position: -1.391998 -22.759998 20.663002
The task will be completed using 1 cpu cores.
Each core will handle 62 translation steps.
Padded translation range: 0.00 - 61.00 Angstrom.
100% complete (approximate, based on root cpu execution status.)
